    <h2 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Privatize McGill.</h2><br>
    <p style="font-size: 12pt; width: 70%;">
        As McGill University continues to commit the heinous crime of existing in their enclave of lower Montreal, a politically-weakened Francois Legault has found it necessary to strangle its baby in the crib. This University, which provides the Quebec government with researchers and professionals, whose students circulate roughly half a billion dollars per year in its economy, who is, by far, the single most respected institution in the province is, unfortunately, an embarrassment. Why? Because, were it not for McGill, there would be 40,000 less English-speakers polluting the downtown air. And, were it not for McGill, Francois Legault wouldn't have to sheild his face when outsiders show respect for one of his province's English-language institutions. This pesky truth has led the current provincial government on a new front in their language war: <i>strangle the anglo universities.</i> <br><br>
        Because that's where they're all coming from, these purveyors of dirty English, with their horrid words like "rural" and "moist." Certainly, it isn't because Quebec is located in a continent with 334 million English speakers, or because English has become, in an age of increased global trade, the preferred language of business. Or perhaps (hear me out), the historical bilingualism of its bad-child metropolis, Montreal, is hard to snuff out completely (one could only imagine global talents like Oscar Peterson flourishing here today--"jazz" is not a French word; one can already see that the operational headquarters of the Bank of Montreal is in Toronto). No, I think I know the <i>real</i> reason why 6.28% of Quebecers don't speak its beloved faux français: it's that 3 out of their 19 public schools teach in English.<br><br>
        Since the COVID pandemic, Quebec's public university system has seen a steady increase in funding, aided significantly by a 2018 deregulation of international tuition fees, which has since created new revenues for (all) of their universities. Legault's government, after deciding last week that fun is bad, has decided to push the narrative that their 16 Francophone universities are underfunded, and that a serious redistribution of revenue is in order. To accomplish this, the out-of-province tuition has been doubled for Bishop's, Concordia, and McGill--to a price, $17,000, which is prohibitively unaffordable and wildly beyond the current tuition market in Canada. The surplus revenue from this doubling will not be retained by the university, but instead redistributed within the Francophone system. Additionally, a greater chunk of money, to the tune of $20,000 per person, will be clawed back from international student fees. Those smarter than I estimate an immediate financial impact of between 100-150 million for Concordia and McGill, with Concordia's losses accounting for roughly 15% of its usual working revenues. 
        <br><br>That is an existential threat.<br><br>
        Nevermind the lack of motivation behind these changes (the "narrative" is false, as one could imagine), but the sheer lunacy the of new out-of-province rates poses a severe limitation on the sorts of out-of-province students, if there are any, that could come to Quebec. Talent will be lost, reputation will be lost, intelligent and qualified students will be lost. Mind you, there will be no lessening of anglophones in Montreal, and there will be no new income to distribute--because students from the rest of Canada will trickle away, and highly lucrative, notable English-speakers (Americans) will take their place to fill budgetary holes.
        <br><br>
        You may still ask, though, if Francophone universities are truly underfunded. To answer, I have the following batch of statistics handy, relative to the most recent budgetary year: the Quebec government provided $429M dollars for a population of 39,513 McGillians. L'Université de Montréal, by contrast, received $662M in grant money for their 37,203 students. As a last data point, the Université de Sherbrooke netted $371M in grants for their 20,598 students. The dollar/student ratios are then: $10,857, $17,794, and $18,011. This trend holds for a further sampling of french-speak universities, Laval, Polytechnique Montréal, and Concordia ($11,036; $11,968; $9,034). Oh, I lied, that last statistic is an anglophone university. Even with the help of all McGill's donors and deregulated international fees, they and Université de Montréal have an common working budget of ~1 billion. And, of all the universities mentioned, McGill accepts the least amount of grant money as a percentage of their working budget. Tell me, CAQ-suckers, what was it about the francophone universities being underfunded? Not enough grant money to go around? Greedy McGill taking too much taxpayer money? Why do I see the poster-child of Quebec's public university system, UdeM, bragging that they have the 3rd highest concentation of international students? Weren't they supposed to be bad for the "decline of French"; don't they give McGill an unfair advantage?<br><br>
        It is as clear as it ever been that the very government which enables McGill to exist wishes it didn't. It is clear that this wish will come at the expense of two other renowned universities in the province, and their students. It is clear, as the title declares, that McGill <i>must</i> privatize to ensure that it still exists in 10 years. And I do not believe, with the overwhelming support of Quebec's majority, that the CAQ will allow McGill to exist, in whatever capacity is significant to this school's heritage, culture, and ethos, in the coming age.

            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 12pt;">
            Suppose you, a mathematician, are trying to find love (we must suspend reality for this). Suppose further that an arbitrary \(N\) amount of people are lining up to see if you'll pick them, but you don't know who exactly is the best among them. How might you optimize the probability that, supposing your soulmate is in line, you pick him\her? The answer to this (initial) question is a somewhat interesting: you interview and reject \(k\) candidates, and then pick the first \((k+i)^{th}\) candidate who is better than all those previous. What is <i>very</i> interesting is the fact that, if \(k\) is picked ideally, the odds of choosing your soulmate are approximately \(\frac{1}{e}\), and what's more, the ideal ratio of \(\frac{k}{N}\) is also \(\frac{1}{e}\)! Here is a rough sketch of the proof:
            \[
            \begin{array}{rl}
            \mathbb{P}(\text{Soulmate chosen}) =& \;  \mathbb{P}(\text{Soulmate chosen in first interview after rejects})\\
            +&  \;  \mathbb{P}(\text{Soulmate chosen in second interview after rejects})\\
            \vdots&\\
            +&  \;  \mathbb{P}(\text{Soulmate chosen in ${N-k}^{th}$ interview after rejects})\\
            =& \sum_{i=1}^{N-k} \mathbb{P}(\text{Soulmate chosen in $i^{th}$ interview after rejects})
	        \end{array}
            \]
            We can apply a little conditional probability as follows:
            \[\sum_{i=1}^{N-k}\mathbb{P}(S \text{ chosen in interview } i) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-k}\mathbb{P}(\text{Given that }S_i = S, \; S_i \text{ is chosen })\mathbb{P}(S_i = S)\]
            where \(S_i\) is the \(i^{th}\) person interviewed after the initial round of rejects, and \(S\) is your soulmate. Immediately, we see that the probability of any candidate being your soulmate, \(\mathbb{P}(S_i = S)\), is \(\frac{1}{N}\). If \(S_i\) is given to be the one, they are chosen only if the lovliest lover thus far was insta-rejected (otherwise, he\she would have been selected, not \(S_i\)). Thus, we have \(\mathbb{P}(S_i\text{ chosen }|S_i = S) = \frac{k}{k+i-1}\). 
            \[\mathbb{P}(S \text{ is chosen}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-k}\mathbb{P}(S \text{ chosen in interview } i) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-k}\frac{k}{N(k+i-1)}\]
            One can express this summation, using some calculus, as an approximation of a Reimman integral, as follows:
            \[m \int_{m}^{1-\varepsilon}\frac{1}{x}dx = m\ln(x)\left|_{m}^{1-\varepsilon}\right. = m\ln(1-\epsilon) - m\ln(m)= -m\ln(m)\]
            where \(m\) is the ratio \(\frac{k}{N}\) as \(N \to \infty\) (and by turns, \(k\) as well). When this expression is maximixed by differentiating and setting to 0, one yields
            <p style="text-align: center;">
            \(\frac{k}{N} = \frac{1}{e} \) and the probability of picking your soulmate with the above-defined ratio is also \(\frac{1}{e}\). That's almost 37%! Out of infinte choice!
