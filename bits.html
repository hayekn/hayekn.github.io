            Suppose you, a mathematician, are trying to find love (we must suspend reality for this). Suppose further that an arbitrary \(N\) amount of people are lining up to see if you'll pick them, but you don't know who exactly is the best among them. How might you optimize the probability that, supposing your soulmate is in line, you pick him\her? The answer to this (initial) question is a somewhat interesting: you interview and reject \(k\) candidates, and then pick the first \((k+i)^{th}\) candidate who is better than all those previous. What is <i>very</i> interesting is the fact that, if \(k\) is picked ideally, the odds of choosing your soulmate are approximately \(\frac{1}{e}\), and what's more, the ideal ratio of \(\frac{k}{N}\) is also \(\frac{1}{e}\)! Here is a rough sketch of the proof:
            \[
            \begin{array}{rl}
            \mathbb{P}(\text{Soulmate chosen}) =& \;  \mathbb{P}(\text{Soulmate chosen in \(k+1^{th}\) interview})\\
            +&  \;  \mathbb{P}(\text{Soulmate chosen in \(k+2^{nd}\) interview})\\
            \vdots&\\
            +&  \;  \mathbb{P}(\text{Soulmate chosen in ${N}^{th}$ interview})\\
            =& \sum_{i=1}^{N-k} \mathbb{P}(\text{Soulmate chosen in $(k+i)^{th}$ interview})
	        \end{array}
            \]
            We can apply a little conditional probability as follows:
            \[\sum_{i=1}^{N-k}\mathbb{P}(S \text{ chosen @ } i) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-k}\mathbb{P}(\text{Given that }S_i = S, \; S_i \text{ chosen })\mathbb{P}(S_i = S)\]
            where \(S_i\) is the \(i^{th}\) person interviewed after the initial round of rejects, and \(S\) is your soulmate. Immediately, we see that the probability of any candidate being your soulmate, \(\mathbb{P}(S_i = S)\), is \(\frac{1}{N}\). If \(S_i\) is given to be the one, they are chosen only if the lovliest lover thus far was insta-rejected (otherwise, he\she would have been selected, not \(S_i\)). Thus, we have \(\mathbb{P}(S_i\text{ chosen }|S_i = S) = \frac{k}{k+i-1}\). 
            \[\mathbb{P}(S \text{ is chosen}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-k}\mathbb{P}(S \text{ chosen in interview } i) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-k}\frac{k}{N(k+i-1)}\]
            One can express this summation, using some calculus, as an approximation of a Reimman integral, as follows:
            \[m \int_{m}^{1-\varepsilon}\frac{1}{x}dx = m\ln(x)\left|_{m}^{1-\varepsilon}\right. = m\ln(1-\epsilon) - m\ln(m)= -m\ln(m)\]
            where \(m\) is the ratio \(\frac{k}{N}\) as \(N \to \infty\) (and by turns, \(k\) as well). When this expression is maximixed by differentiating and setting to 0, one yields
            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 12pt;">
            \(\frac{k}{N} = \frac{1}{e} \) and the probability of picking your soulmate with the above-defined ratio is also \(\frac{1}{e}\). That's almost 37%! Out of infinte choice!

        Some years ago I created a virtual instrument using a model B Steinway I had available to me. If you happen to use the DAW <a href="https://www.reasonstudios.com/" class="inline" target="_blank">Reason</a>, in <a href="https://mcgill-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/nicholas_hayek_mail_mcgill_ca/EfAcfL2cuSRJom7Nsg9iwS0BZ5mXprXEn4m9uCDn4cgKdw?e=ciHIHP" class="inline" target="_blank">this zip file</a> you'll find an .sxt <a href="https://www.reasonstudios.com/en/reason/instruments/nn-xt" class="inline" target="_blank">instrument</a> compatible with Reason, along with all the 416 individual clip recordings of a piano from my hometown. Below are some audio samples of a robot (credits to <a href="https://bushgrafts.com/" class="inline" target="_blank">Doug McKenzie</a> for the midi files) playing it.

    <h2 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><i>Strangle the Anglo Universities</i></h2>
    <p class="mcgill">
        <a id="CAQ" style="visibility: hidden;"></a><br>
        Last month, the office of a <a href="https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/jean-talon-byelection-results" class="inlinep" target="_blank">politically-weakened</a> Francois Legault found it necessary to crank the heat on Quebec's three anglophone universities, all but financially strangling McGill, Concordia, and Bishop's University. Since the 1970s, McGill University, in particular, has been a source of bitterness in the face of the preeminent Francophone zeitgeist. McGill is Quebec's colonial baby, which—aside from providing Quebec with doctors, researchers, professionals, and contributing <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/mcgill-university-injects-49-billion-quebec-economy-over-ten-years-9572" class="inlinep" target="_blank">billions</a> to its economy—is perhaps only seen as a roadblock to the complete Francization of its public education system.<br><br>

        Were it not for McGill, there might be 40,000 less English-speakers polluting the downtown air of Montreal. True. Were in not for McGill, Legault wouldn't have to waver uncomfortably, as he does, between bragging about and disparaging a highly visible, English-speaking asset. <a href="https://montrealgazette.com/business/local-business/montreal-is-biggest-reason-quebec-is-poorer-than-ontario-girard" class="inlinep" target="_blank">As the Finance Minister said</a> only weeks before the lastest "wavering": Quebec is falling behind English-speaking Canada because our universities are falling behind—because "the University of Toronto is now ranked ahead of McGill." Therein lies an odd contradiction, and if language politics in Quebec are taken to be as impassioned as they're usually marketed, an undercurrent of disdain for the Laurentian elites of yore could be to credit. In any case, for whatever motivations, the current provincial government has opened up a new frontier in its language wars: <i>strangle the anglo universities.</i> <br><br>
        <!--How does one satisfy voters' tastes for Franco-nationalist rhetoric while remaining serious about the economic slippage of Quebec with respect to English-speaking Canada?-->
        Because that's where they're all coming from, these purveyors of dirty English, with their horrid words like "rural" and "moist." Certainly, it isn't because Quebec is located in a continent with 334 million English speakers, or because English has become, in an age of increased global trade, the preferred language of business. Or, perhaps, it's because Quebec's shining metropolis, Montreal, is horribly bilingual.

        <!--(decreasingly so, however—one can only imagine a neighborhood like <a href="https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/opinion-remembering-the-little-burgundy-expropriations" class="inlinep" target="_blank">Little Burgundy</a> existing as it did; one can already see that the operational headquarters of the Bank of Montreal is in Toronto)-->
        No, I think I know the <i>real</i> reason why <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?LANG=E&GENDERlist=1,2,3&STATISTIClist=1,4&DGUIDlist=2021A000224&HEADERlist=,15,13,18,12,16,14,17&SearchText=Quebec" class="inlinep" target="_blank">6.30%</a> of Quebecers don't speak CAQ's beloved français: it's that 3 out of their 19 public universities teach in English.<br><br>

        Quebec's university system has, in recent years, seen a steady <a href="https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-boosts-funding-to-universities-deregulates-foreign-tuition#:~:text=QUEBEC%20%E2%80%94%20The%20province's%20university%20network,tuition%20rates%20for%20foreign%20students." class="inlinep" target="_blank">increase in provincial funding</a>, aided significantly by a 2018 deregulation of international tuition fees, which has created new revenue streams for (all of) their universities. Even still, it's generally accepted that the system, which operates on a budget of a few billion, is still under-funded. Legault's government, after ostensibly deciding that education reform was too expensive, began circulating a false <a href="https://www.quebec.ca/nouvelles/actualites/details/nouveau-modele-de-tarification-pour-les-etudiants-hors-quebec-51195" class="inlinep" target="_blank">narrative</a> that their 16 francophone universities are cash-starved not due to inadequate government spending (it is a public system, after all), but due to <i>"overfunding"</i> of the 3 English-language universities. Such talking points of anglophone privilege and preferential treatment are common to the Quebec political landscape, even though it may be a <a href="https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat=19860604&id=20kwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UqgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2077,689000&hl=en" class="inlinep" target="_blank">crime to sell</a> "smoked meat" without translating the menu into French first. A serious redistribution of revenue, Leagult says, is in order. To accomplish this, out-of-province tuition has been doubled for Bishop's, Concordia, and McGill—to a price, $17,000, which is prohibitively unaffordable and wildly ahead of the current market rate for tuition <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/210908/t003a-eng.htm" class="inlinep" target="_blank">in Canada and Quebec</a>. To add insult to injury, the surplus revenue from this doubling will not be retained by the universities, but instead redistributed within the francophone system. To add a gut-punch to the insult to the injury, a big chunk of change, to the tune of $20,000 per person, <a href="https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-to-double-tuition-fees-for-out-of-province-students-attending-english-universities" class="inlinep" target="_blank">will be taken</a> from international student fees, whereas previously they were left untouched by the government. <br><br>

        In total, McGill estimates an upper bound of $94M in lost annual revenue (a tenth of its working budget), an 80% reduction in non-Quebec Canadian enrollment, and layoffs numbering between 650-700. Principal Deep Saini expressed concern over the survival of its music school. Infrastructure projects are on hold. For Concordia, with roughly 10,000 international students, the $20,000 claw-back is an existential blow. <br><br>

        Nevermind the lack of motivation behind these changes (the "narrative" is false, as one could imagine), but the sheer lunacy of the new out-of-province rates poses a severe limitation on the sorts of Canadians that can come to Quebec. Talent will be lost and the reputation of McGill will take a beating. Mind you, there will be no lessening of anglophones in Montreal, and there will be no new income to distribute—because students from the rest of Canada will arrive in fewer and fewer numbers, and highly lucrative American students, a notably English-speaking group, will take their place to fill budgetary holes.<br><br>

        You may still ask, though, if francophone universities truly do get the short end of the government stick. To answer, I have the following batch of statistics handy, relative to the most recent budgetary year: the Quebec government <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/apb/files/apb/budget_2023-2024_-_en.pdf" class="inlinep" target="_blank">provided</a> $429M dollars for a population of 39,513 McGillians. L'Université de Montréal, by contrast, <a href="https://secretariatgeneral.umontreal.ca/public/secretariatgeneral/documents/doc_officiels/documents-institutionnels/budget/Budget_fonctionnement_UdeM_2023-2024.pdf" class="inlinep" target="_blank">received</a> $662M in grant money for their 37,203 students. The Université de Sherbrooke <a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/decouvrir/fileadmin/sites/decouvrir/documents/direction/budget/budget_2023-2024.pdf" class="inlinep" target="_blank">netted</a> $371M in grants for their 20,598 students. The dollar/student ratios are then: $10,857, $17,794, and $18,011. This trend holds for a further smattering of publicly-funded Quebec universities, <a href="https://www.ulaval.ca/sites/default/files/notre-universite/direction-gouvernance/bsg/documents-officiels/budgets-etats-financiers/financial-statements-2022-04-30.pdf" class="inlinep" target="_blank">Laval</a>, <a href="https://share.polymtl.ca/alfresco/service/api/path/content;cm:content/workspace/SpacesStore/Company%20Home/Sites/service-des-finances-web/documentLibrary/etats_financier/etats_financiers_2022.pdf.pdf?a=false&guest=true" class="inlinep" target="_blank"> Polytechnique Montréal</a>, and <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/concordia/services/financial/docs/BudgetConversationsNov2022.pdf" class="inlinep" target="_blank">Concordia</a> ($11,036; $11,968; $9,034). Even with the help of all McGill's donors and international students, it and Université de Montréal have a common working budget of ~$1B. <br><br>
        
        Tell me, CAQ overlords, is there not enough grant money to go around? Are you clawing for an excuse to explain why the system, as a whole, is underfunded? And <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/en/udem/in-figures/" class="inlinep" target="_blank">what's this</a>: the poster-child of the university system, UdeM, bragging that they have the 3rd highest concentration of international students in Canada? Don't those students have an <a href="https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/prove-out-of-province-students-cause-decline-of-french-liberals-tell-caq" class="inlinep" target="_blank">"anglicizing effect"</a> on Quebec? Doesn't all that deregulated tuition give UdeM an unfair advantage, just like it does McGill?<br><br>

        It is as clear as it ever been that the very government which enables McGill to exist wishes it did not. It is clear that bitterness and political desperation have put three renowned universities and their students on the chopping block. If McGill wishes to exist in 10 years, I believe it must privatize. Maybe fortunately, Leagult's line-of-attack is not broad enough to trigger the sort of generational resistance that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Quebec_student_protests"class="inlinep" target="_blank">occurred in 2012</a>. And I certainly do not believe, with the <a href="https://338canada.com/quebec/" class="inlinep" target="_blank">overwhelming support</a> of Quebec's majority to back it, that the CAQ will allow McGill to exist, in whatever capacity is significant to this school's heritage and culture, for so long.
