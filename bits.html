    <h2 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><i>Strangle the Anglo Universities</i></h2><br>
    <p class="mcgill">
        As McGill University continues, every day, to commit the heinous crime of existing in its enclave of lower Montreal, a <a href="https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/jean-talon-byelection-results" class="inlinep" target="_blank">politically-weakened</a> Francois Legault has found it necessary to strangle his baby in the crib, as it were. This colonial baby, which provides Quebec with doctors, researchers, and professionals, which contributes <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/mcgill-university-injects-49-billion-quebec-economy-over-ten-years-9572" class="inlinep" target="_blank">billions</a> to its economy, and which garners more domestic and international respect than any other educational institution in the province is, unfortunately, an embarrassment. Why? Because, were it not for McGill, there might be 40,000 less English-speakers polluting the downtown air. And, were it not for McGill, Francois Legault wouldn't have to sheild his face when outsiders compliment one of his province's anglophone institutions. This pesky truth has led the current provincial government to open up a new frontier in the language wars: <i>strangle the anglo universities.</i> <br><br>

        Because that's where they're all coming from, these purveyors of dirty English, with their horrid words like "rural" and "moist." Certainly, it isn't because Quebec is located in a continent with 334 million English speakers, or because English has become, in an age of increased global trade, the preferred language of business. Or, perhaps, it's because Quebec's shining metropolis, Montreal, is horribly bilingual (decreasingly so—one can only imagine a neighborhood like <a href="https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/opinion-remembering-the-little-burgundy-expropriations" class="inlinep" target="_blank">Little Burgundy</a> existing as it did; one can already see that the operational headquarters of the Bank of Montreal is in Toronto). No, I think I know the <i>real</i> reason why <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?LANG=E&GENDERlist=1,2,3&STATISTIClist=1,4&DGUIDlist=2021A000224&HEADERlist=,15,13,18,12,16,14,17&SearchText=Quebec" class="inlinep" target="_blank">6.30%</a> of Quebecers don't speak CAQ's beloved faux français: it's that 3 out of their 19 public universities teach in English.<br><br>

        Quebec's university system has, in recent years, seen a steady <a href="https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-boosts-funding-to-universities-deregulates-foreign-tuition#:~:text=QUEBEC%20%E2%80%94%20The%20province's%20university%20network,tuition%20rates%20for%20foreign%20students." class="inlinep" target="_blank">increase in provincial funding</a>, aided significantly by a 2018 deregulation of international tuition fees, which has created new revenue streams for (all of) their universities. Even still, it's generally accepted that the system, which operates on a budget of a few billion, is still under-funded. Legault's government, after deciding that education reform was too boring, began circulating a false <a href="https://www.quebec.ca/nouvelles/actualites/details/nouveau-modele-de-tarification-pour-les-etudiants-hors-quebec-51195" class="inlinep" target="_blank">narrative</a> that their 16 francophone universities are cash-starved not due to inadequate government spending (it is a public system, after all), but due to <i>"overfunding"</i> of the 3 English-language universities. Such talking points of anglophone privilege and preferential treatment are common to the Quebec political landscape, even though it may be a crime to sell "smoked meat" without translating the menu into French first. A serious redistribution of revenue, Leagult says, is in order. To accomplish this, out-of-province tuition has been doubled for Bishop's, Concordia, and McGill—to a price, $17,000, which is prohibitively unaffordable and wildly ahead of the current market rate for tuition <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/210908/t003a-eng.htm" class="inlinep" target="_blank">in Canada and Quebec</a>. To add insult to injury, the surplus revenue from this doubling will not be retained by the universities, but instead redistributed within the francophone system. To add a gut-punch to the insult to the injury, a big chunk of change, to the tune of $20,000 per person, <a href="https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-to-double-tuition-fees-for-out-of-province-students-attending-english-universities" class="inlinep" target="_blank">will be taken</a> from international student fees, whereas previously they were left untouched by the government (this alone will cost McGill roughly 240M, the majority of its tuition revenue). For Concordia, with roughly 10,000 international students, the $20,000 claw-back is an existential blow. <br><br>

        Nevermind the lack of motivation behind these changes (the "narrative" is false, as one could imagine), but the sheer lunacy of the new out-of-province rates poses a severe limitation on the sorts of Canadians that can come to Quebec. Talent will be lost, reputations will be lost, intelligent and qualified students will be lost. Mind you, there will be no lessening of anglophones in Montreal, and there will be no new income to distribute—because students from the rest of Canada will arrive in fewer and fewer numbers, and highly lucrative, notably English-speaking Americans will take their place to fill budgetary holes.<br><br>

        You may still ask, though, if francophone universities truly do get the short end of the government stick. To answer, I have the following batch of statistics handy, relative to the most recent budgetary year: the Quebec government <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/apb/files/apb/budget_2023-2024_-_en.pdf" class="inlinep" target="_blank">provided</a> $429M dollars for a population of 39,513 McGillians. L'Université de Montréal, by contrast, <a href="https://secretariatgeneral.umontreal.ca/public/secretariatgeneral/documents/doc_officiels/documents-institutionnels/budget/Budget_fonctionnement_UdeM_2023-2024.pdf" class="inlinep" target="_blank">received</a> $662M in grant money for their 37,203 students. The Université de Sherbrooke <a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/decouvrir/fileadmin/sites/decouvrir/documents/direction/budget/budget_2023-2024.pdf" class="inlinep" target="_blank">netted</a> $371M in grants for their 20,598 students. The dollar/student ratios are then: $10,857, $17,794, and $18,011. This trend holds for a further sampling of French-speak universities, <a href="https://www.ulaval.ca/sites/default/files/notre-universite/direction-gouvernance/bsg/documents-officiels/budgets-etats-financiers/financial-statements-2022-04-30.pdf" class="inlinep" target="_blank">Laval</a>, <a href="https://share.polymtl.ca/alfresco/service/api/path/content;cm:content/workspace/SpacesStore/Company%20Home/Sites/service-des-finances-web/documentLibrary/etats_financier/etats_financiers_2022.pdf.pdf?a=false&guest=true" class="inlinep" target="_blank"> Polytechnique Montréal</a>, and <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/concordia/services/financial/docs/BudgetConversationsNov2022.pdf" class="inlinep" target="_blank">Concordia</a> ($11,036; $11,968; $9,034). Oh, I lied, that last statistic is an anglophone university. Even with the help of all McGill's donors and deregulated international fees, it and Université de Montréal have a common working budget of ~$1B. Of all the universities mentioned, too, McGill accepts the lowest share of grant money as a percentage of revenue. <br><br>
        
        Tell me, CAQ overlords (CAQ-suckers), are McGill and Concordia really sucking the pool dry? Is there not enough grant money to go around? Are you clawing for an excuse to explain why the system, as a whole, is underfunded?
        <br><br>
        
        And what's this: the poster-child of the university system, UdeM, <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/en/udem/in-figures/" class="inlinep" target="_blank">bragging</a> that they have the 3rd highest concentation of international students in Canada? Don't they have an <a href="https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/prove-out-of-province-students-cause-decline-of-french-liberals-tell-caq" class="inlinep" target="_blank">"anglicizing effect"</a> on Quebec? Doesn't all that deregulated tuition give UdeM an unfair advantage, just like it does McGill? <br><br>
        
        Do you hope to avoid another <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/quebec-student-protest-of-2012" class="inlinep" target="_blank">2012</a> by targetting a minority population this time around?<br><br>

        It is as clear as it ever been that the very government which enables McGill to exist wishes it did not. It is clear that bitterness and populism have put three renowned universities and their students on the chopping block. It is clear that McGill <i>must</i> privatize to ensure that it still exists in 10 years. And I do not believe, with the <a href="https://338canada.com/quebec/" class="inlinep" target="_blank">overwhelming support</a> of Quebec's majority to back it, that the CAQ will allow McGill to exist, in whatever capacity is significant to this school's heritage and culture, for too long.

            Suppose you, a mathematician, are trying to find love (we must suspend reality for this). Suppose further that an arbitrary \(N\) amount of people are lining up to see if you'll pick them, but you don't know who exactly is the best among them. How might you optimize the probability that, supposing your soulmate is in line, you pick him\her? The answer to this (initial) question is a somewhat interesting: you interview and reject \(k\) candidates, and then pick the first \((k+i)^{th}\) candidate who is better than all those previous. What is <i>very</i> interesting is the fact that, if \(k\) is picked ideally, the odds of choosing your soulmate are approximately \(\frac{1}{e}\), and what's more, the ideal ratio of \(\frac{k}{N}\) is also \(\frac{1}{e}\)! Here is a rough sketch of the proof:
            \[
            \begin{array}{rl}
            \mathbb{P}(\text{Soulmate chosen}) =& \;  \mathbb{P}(\text{Soulmate chosen in \(k+1^{th}\) interview})\\
            +&  \;  \mathbb{P}(\text{Soulmate chosen in \(k+2^{nd}\) interview})\\
            \vdots&\\
            +&  \;  \mathbb{P}(\text{Soulmate chosen in ${N}^{th}$ interview})\\
            =& \sum_{i=1}^{N-k} \mathbb{P}(\text{Soulmate chosen in $(k+i)^{th}$ interview})
	        \end{array}
            \]
            We can apply a little conditional probability as follows:
            \[\sum_{i=1}^{N-k}\mathbb{P}(S \text{ chosen @ } i) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-k}\mathbb{P}(\text{Given that }S_i = S, \; S_i \text{ chosen })\mathbb{P}(S_i = S)\]
            where \(S_i\) is the \(i^{th}\) person interviewed after the initial round of rejects, and \(S\) is your soulmate. Immediately, we see that the probability of any candidate being your soulmate, \(\mathbb{P}(S_i = S)\), is \(\frac{1}{N}\). If \(S_i\) is given to be the one, they are chosen only if the lovliest lover thus far was insta-rejected (otherwise, he\she would have been selected, not \(S_i\)). Thus, we have \(\mathbb{P}(S_i\text{ chosen }|S_i = S) = \frac{k}{k+i-1}\). 
            \[\mathbb{P}(S \text{ is chosen}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-k}\mathbb{P}(S \text{ chosen in interview } i) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-k}\frac{k}{N(k+i-1)}\]
            One can express this summation, using some calculus, as an approximation of a Reimman integral, as follows:
            \[m \int_{m}^{1-\varepsilon}\frac{1}{x}dx = m\ln(x)\left|_{m}^{1-\varepsilon}\right. = m\ln(1-\epsilon) - m\ln(m)= -m\ln(m)\]
            where \(m\) is the ratio \(\frac{k}{N}\) as \(N \to \infty\) (and by turns, \(k\) as well). When this expression is maximixed by differentiating and setting to 0, one yields
            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 12pt;">
            \(\frac{k}{N} = \frac{1}{e} \) and the probability of picking your soulmate with the above-defined ratio is also \(\frac{1}{e}\). That's almost 37%! Out of infinte choice!

        Some years ago I created a virtual instrument using a model B Steinway I had available to me. If you happen to use the DAW <a href="https://www.reasonstudios.com/" class="inline" target="_blank">Reason</a>, in <a href="https://mcgill-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/nicholas_hayek_mail_mcgill_ca/EfAcfL2cuSRJom7Nsg9iwS0BZ5mXprXEn4m9uCDn4cgKdw?e=ciHIHP" class="inline" target="_blank">this zip file</a> you'll find an .sxt <a href="https://www.reasonstudios.com/en/reason/instruments/nn-xt" class="inline" target="_blank">instrument</a> compatible with Reason, along with all the 416 individual clip recordings of a piano from my hometown. Below are some audio samples of a robot (credits to <a href="https://bushgrafts.com/" class="inline" target="_blank">Doug McKenzie</a> for the midi files) playing it.
